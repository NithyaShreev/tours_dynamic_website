        Renowned as the ‘Yoga Capital of the World’, Rishikesh earned its fame when the popular English rock band Beatles visited the place back in the 60s. The famous band, seeking spirituality, spent their time at the Ashram of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.

While spending some time at this ashram is a given when visiting this spiritual city, there are plenty of other places that demand your attention. Start your day with river rafting at Shivpuri followed by a simple breakfast at one of the riverside cafes and then roam around the various shops lined along Laxman Jhula.

Finally, unwind at the Ghat and submerge yourself in the magnificent and stunningly tranquil Ganga Aarti in the evening. And if you need a detailed guide to help you plan your entire itinerary, take cues from this one. Read ahead to know about the popular places to visit in Rishikesh:
